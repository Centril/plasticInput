plasticInput
============
plasticInput is a jQuery plugin that attempts to normalize some of the most common HTML form inputs.
At the moment these are: text, password, textarea, radio, checkbox, file, select.
Currently multiselect is not supported, but may be in the near future.
Also, a possible port to jQuery.ui is also feasible.

It requires jQuery 1.6+
